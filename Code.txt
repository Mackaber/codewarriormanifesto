Code Warrior Manifesto V. 0.1
======================

# This is something I wrote to get inspired for those nights of hacking,
# I based it on how I felt when I went to several Hackathon events.
# Feel free to modify it and make it your own.

It's again 3:00am in the morning, just like yesterday
and I'm just getting started.

I feel the ideas flowing in my mind like a horde of warriors
crushing without mercy all the problems I found.

My hands against the keyboard feels like I'm wielding a sacred sword
which I use to command all my code.

The coffe by my side tastes like the blood of my adversaries.

Sleep is for the weak, those who fight shall last
and those who surrender shall fall.

It may not help me get profit, It may not make the world a better place...
But I won't rest until every problem gets solved.

Keep breaking to figure out how it works, 
keep changing the paradigm and always try something new.
Keep that mind open, and keep those ideas flowing.

From the little script to the full featured framework..
Programming languages, IDEs, frameworks are just tools from the box.
It doesn't matter which one I select, in every way I will master it.

This is what I like, 
This is what I do, 
How I do it… 
This is what I am, 
this is what I chose to be, 
because this… is me…

So from now on, when I'm asked...

"Programmer What is our profession?"

I will respond...

CODE!

CODE!

CODE!

#Now, keep repeating it to yourself until you believe in it.
